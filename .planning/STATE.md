# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** Every user action must either succeed visibly or fail with a clear, actionable message -- no silent data loss, no undetected errors, no security gaps.
**Current focus:** Phase 22 — live-site-video-per-project-hls-camera-feeds-tied-to-project

## Current Position

Milestone: v2.1
Phase: 22 (live-site-video-per-project-hls-camera-feeds-tied-to-project) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 12
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-15

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

v2.0 closing decisions:

- Reduced v2.0 scope to phases 18, 20, 21 after 2026-04-14 audit found 6/9 phases unverified and 4 critical integration blockers
- Phases 13–17, 19 code left on `main` but milestone ownership reassigned to v2.1 pending verification
- Quick task 260414-n4w closed INT-03/04/05 (iOS NavTab wiring, DailyCrewView upsert, AgendaListView wiring) immediately before milestone close
- Milestone renamed from "Feature Expansion" to "Portal & AI Expansion" to reflect actual shipped surface
- [Phase 23]: DailyCrewView projectId becomes internal @AppStorage state; zero-arg init lets NavTab routing instantiate it directly (Phase 23-01)
- [Phase 23]: Phase 23 closed: VERIFICATION.md proves 5/5 goal-backward criteria (INT-03/04/05 CLOSED, FLOW-03/04/05 RESTORED); 5 requirements flipped to Satisfied
- [Phase 22]: [Phase 22]: Wave 0 scaffolding complete — 9 vitest stubs, 4 XCTest stubs, worker/ skeleton, 4 Mux webhook fixtures. Every Wave 1-4 automated verify command now resolves to a file on main.
- [Phase 22]: [Phase 22]: Pre-existing async/concurrency compile errors in ready_player_8Tests.swift + ReportTests.swift logged to deferred-items.md; Phase 22 iOS waves must either bundle a fix or use compile-only verification until Phase 28.

### Pending Todos

None.

### v2.1 Open Blockers

- INT-01: RLS references non-existent cs_rfis/cs_submittals/cs_change_orders — Phase 26
- INT-02: Document routes do not emit cs_activity_events — Phase 24
- INT-06: Cert expiration does not trigger notifications — Phase 25
- INT-07: Portal home has no /map navigation link — Phase 27
- Phase 22 (Live Site Video) never planned — requires /gsd-plan-phase 22
- 15 human UAT items across phases 20, 21 remain unchecked (browser/device required)
